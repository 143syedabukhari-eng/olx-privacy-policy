Privacy Policy
Effective Date: February 16, 2026
This Privacy Policy describes how the OLX Data Extractor & Lead Scraper ("the Extension") handles user information.
1. Data Collection and Usage
The Extension is a tool designed to help users extract marketplace listing data for research purposes. All data extraction and processing occur locally on the user's computer.
•
No Personal Data Collection: We do not collect, store, or transmit any personal information about you to external servers.
•
Local Storage: Scraped data (such as listing titles, prices, and phone numbers) is stored locally in your browser's storage only.
•
User Control: You can clear all stored data at any time by clicking the "Clear Data" button within the extension popup.       
2. Permissions Justification
To function correctly, the extension requires the following permissions:
•
activeTab: To read the content of the OLX page you are currently viewing.
•
storage: To save your scraped results locally so they aren't lost when you close the browser.
3. Third-Party Access
The Extension does not share any data with third-party services, advertisers, or analytics providers. Your research data belongs entirely to you.
4. Changes to This Policy
We may update our Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify you of any changes by posting the new Privacy Policy on this page.
